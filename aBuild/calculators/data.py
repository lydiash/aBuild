# the way I thought up, and the other is Wiley's way.  Wiley's
# way is probably right because he has thought of it for longer.
# My way:
#     1- Find the concentration-weighted average of the pure atomic
#        volumes.  This is the target volume for the crystal.
#     2- The lattice parameter is then found by dividing the target
#        atomic volume by the current atomic volume and then taking
#        cubed root.
# Wiley's way:
#     1- Find the lattice paramter that the crystal would have if it was
#        pure A(B,C,etc).
#     2- Perform a concentration-weighted average over the lattice parameters.
#
#     The two methods are mathematically very similar but if the
#     mismatch is large, the difference can get larger.
